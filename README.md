# churn-ml-api
# Customer Churn Prediction ML System

End-to-end machine learning system to predict telecom customer churn and deploy predictions via a FastAPI backend with Docker containerization.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project builds a production-ready churn prediction pipeline:

- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training & tuning
- Explainability using SHAP
- FastAPI inference API
- Docker deployment

## 📊 Model Performance

- Accuracy: ~72%
- Recall: ~80%+
- ROC-AUC: ~0.84

Optimized for recall due to imbalanced churn dataset.

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas / NumPy
- FastAPI
- Docker
- Joblib
- SHAP
